6) Proof & Credibility Requirements
Proof assets to include (high-level, non-confidential)

“Trusted by teams in complex environments” section

Recognizable client names where allowed (e.g., Dynavox, Ramudden, Sandvik, Rusta) presented professionally

3–5 “case snapshots” (short)

Challenge → Approach → Outcome

“Delivery metrics” style bullets (avoid exact sensitive numbers unless verified)

e.g., “multi-country rollouts”, “tenant consolidation”, “service governance uplift”, “M&A integration framework”

Tone of proof

No bragging

Calm, factual, outcome-based

Emphasis on scope and responsibility

7) Visual Design Direction
Aesthetic

Premium modern tech with a consulting authority feel:

minimal layout

strong typography hierarchy

generous whitespace

sharp grid

subtle gradients and glass/blur accents (sparingly)

high-contrast but not harsh

Color direction (conceptual)

Base: off-white / soft gray

Primary text: near-black

Accent: muted electric blue OR muted emerald/teal

Secondary accent: slate / graphite

Avoid loud/neon colors; avoid “startup candy” palettes

Typography direction

Modern sans-serif

Strong headings; clean body copy

Tight but readable line-height

Consistent scale (design tokens)

Imagery & graphics

No cliché stock photos

Prefer:

abstract tech patterns

subtle gridlines

geometric shapes

light noise texture

minimal icons

8) Interaction & Micro-Animations (Signature Feel)

Micro-animations should make the site feel alive but not distracting.

Principles

Subtle, quick, purposeful

150–300ms typical

Use easing (not linear)

Respect reduced-motion preferences

Never slow down reading

Required micro-interactions

Button hover: slight lift + soft glow + border shift

Link hover: underline reveal / animated underline

Section reveal on scroll: fade + slight translate (very subtle)

Cards: hover elevation + gradient border shimmer (subtle)

Header: sticky with slight blur/backdrop and shrink transition

CTA block: gentle animated background gradient (slow, tasteful)

Page transitions (optional): fade/slide between routes

9) Content & Tone Guidelines
Voice

Confident, senior, precise

Clear and structured

Avoid hype, avoid buzzwords

Prefer outcomes, scope, responsibility, method

Messaging rules

“XIGO” first, not personal-first

Mention leadership background as proof, not identity

Use “we” language (company voice)

Keep sentences short and skimmable

Use bullets for clarity

Provide concrete examples of what clients ask for

10) Homepage Structure (Conversion-first)
Above the fold (Hero)

Headline: clear, authoritative

Subheadline: what we do + who we help

Primary CTA: Book a call / Contact

Secondary CTA: View Services / Experience

Visual: subtle tech background / gradient / abstract pattern

Below fold sections

Service areas (5 cards)

“How we help” (3-step approach)

Proof (client logos/names + outcomes)

Case snapshots (3 cards)

Why XIGO (differentiators)

CTA block (contact)

11) “How We Work” Model (Simple Framework)

A short, confident method that sounds like consulting maturity:

Align — clarify scope, outcomes, constraints, stakeholders

Structure — plan, governance, RAID, dependencies, delivery model

Deliver — execute, de-risk, communicate, stabilize and handover

Show this as a clean 3-step visual component.

12) Contact & Conversion Requirements

Contact options must be frictionless:

Simple contact form (name, email, message)

Direct email link

LinkedIn link

Optional: “Book a 20-min call” (if integrated)

CTA language:

“Talk to XIGO”

“Discuss your initiative”

“Book a discovery call”

High-fidelity page layout (responsive)
